# NGINX Instance Manager Infrastructure

This repo contains instructions that can be used to generate images using the [NGINX Instance Manager Ansible role](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-management-suite) and [NGINX Ansible role](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx). It also provides example infrastructure to deploy those images with Terraform using best practice security configuration.
