## Getting Started

- For deploying to GCP with terraform, you will need to login to gcloud:

Download and install the cli using these instructions: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install before signing in:

```shell
gcloud auth application-default login
```

- Set terraform parameters in an optional `.tfvars` file

```shell
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

- Use an environment variable to store the admin password you would like to use.

```
export TF_VAR_admin_password=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

- Add the required IP ranges to the "incoming_cidr_blocks" in order to access the NMS service.

- Initialise Terraform

      terraform init
  ```

- Populate the .tfvars file with vars relative to your environment.
